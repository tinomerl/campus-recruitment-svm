For this assignment the campus recruiment dataset from kaggle is used.[[1]](#kaggle_dataset) The goal is to use SVMs to answer the following questions tasked for the dataset.\n",

    "By first looking at the description of the dataframe it seems, that besides `salary` every column has every cell filled. That is really good. But we will still evaluate this finding later on. Another finding for the `salary` column is the extreme max value. The 75% quantile is 300000. The max value however is 940000. More than three times the 75% quantile. Therefore special attention should be paid to this column.\n",
